## Welcome to Material

Material is an animation and graphics framework that is used to create beautiful applications.

## About Material 2

The first version of Material was to bring Material Design to iOS. We considered that a great starting point, but not the entire story. Material 2 is the next chapter, which goes deeper into iOS with refined APIs that simplify Architecture, Photo Library, Reminders, Text Editing, Photo & Video, and much more. In addition to Material Design, we love Appleâ€™s flat UI. Having this in mind, we made it possible to accomplish both UI styles with ease.
